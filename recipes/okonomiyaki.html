            <h3>Description</h3>
            <p>Okonomiyaki is a popular Japanese savory pancake that's as versatile as it is delicious. 
                Its name translates to "grilled as you like it," and true to its name, 
                it's customizable with various ingredients. A batter made from flour, grated yam, eggs, and 
                shredded cabbage forms the base, and additions like pork belly, shrimp, squid, or cheese are often mixed in. Once cooked on a griddle, 
                it's topped with a rich okonomiyaki sauce, Japanese mayonnaise, bonito flakes, and seaweed powder, creating a harmonious blend of flavors and textures.</p>
